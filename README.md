# silverorange Retreat 2020 Hackathon

In this hackathon you are part of a group of three and need to develop a game
like the Mario Paint flyswatter game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAQXJbfihxo

Instead of flys, you will be eliminating COVID-19 viruses!

The rules of the game are intentionally loosly defined. There should be viruses
on the screen that you need to disinfect. Appearance, quantity, movement,
score, sound effects, etc, are all up to your team.
